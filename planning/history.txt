The intent of this app is to display stocks and allow virtual purchases with virtual money. Plans for the future
are to change the UI to an analogous kid friendly UI to facilitate financial education. This is
a mobile application and will use Flutter for the frontend. 

A NoSQL database may still work, as we are not having to store stock info, but user specific stock info. 
Research for a thorough understanding of SQL joins to see if SQL is necessary

Database will likely use PostgreSQL as the database instead of local storage, sacrificing faster local time
for the globability of the database. Users will be able to log in and access their info on any device. 
Still deciding for the backend server language between dart and python (flask)

App Architecture
frontend
Restful API, maybe use firebase for authorization
Backend server with stock API info
Database

Functional App Requirements:
A home screen displaying "purchased" stocks and how they are doing
    The screen should also display the progress of the user's portfolio
    The user should be able to click on the stocks and be taken to the page where they can see more
Stock search page
    The user can search for stocks by their symbols and by the company names
Stock page
    This screen should display the progress of the individual stocks
    This includes graphs, important info, and if the user has a stake in it, how the stake is doing
    If the user doesn't have a stake, add the option for them to buy it
Navigation
    A sidebar to navigate between the pages
Login/Registration

Non-functional App Requirements:
Quick display and access of data
Keep the app relatively lightweight


Backend requirements:
Info on users
    Registration info
    Their stocks
    Their virtual currency left
Info on stocks  
    Current price
    If the user bought it, when they did (this might require a table join)
    Stock metrics provided by the API I pick
Research how the API works: does it maintain a live connection in the application to frequently update
changes in stock price? Or do I have to actively keep calling for new info?


Implementation Plan:
I will be implementing the UI first and then later implementing the backend, as done in the ReactPhotoBoard.
This is so that I can get some development done while putting in more research as to how to construct
my backend.
