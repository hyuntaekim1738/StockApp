The intent of this app is to display stocks and allow virtual purchases. Plans for the future
are to change the UI to an analogous kid friendly UI to facilitate financial education. This is
a mobile application and will use Flutter for the frontend and will likely use PostgreSQL as the
database due to the relational nature of querying stock data. I will likely use flask as the backend
library, and I need to find a live stock info API.

Requirements:
A home screen displaying "purchased" stocks and how they are doing
    The screen should also display the progress of the user's portfolio
    The user should be able to click on the stocks and be taken to the page where they can see more
Stock search page
    The user can search for stocks by their symbols and by the company names
Stock page
    This screen should display the progress of the individual stocks
    This includes graphs, important info, and if the user has a stake in it, how the stake is doing
    If the user doesn't have a stake, add the option for them to buy it
Navigation
    A sidebar to navigate between the pages
Login/Registration

Implementation Plan:
I will be implementing the UI first and then later implementing the backend, as done in the ReactPhotoBoard.
This is so that I can get some development done while putting in more research as to how to construct
my backend.

The implementation order will start with essential functions first, such as login/registration (every stocks
transition needs a user id to identify to).
    Implementation order:
    Login/Registration
    Stock page
    Stock search page
    Home page
